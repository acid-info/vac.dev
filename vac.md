# Vac researches peer-to-peer, private, censorship resistant communication.


## About Vac
Vac is an R&D org creating modular p2p protocols for private, secure, censorship resistant communication.
Researching All Layers

### Researching All Layers
Concerned with all layers in the stack including underlying transports, p2p overlays and routing, initial trust establishment, and semantics for things like group chat.

### Peer-to-Peer
The protocols we work on are pure peer-to-peer, and aim to minimize centralization. This too is in opposition to many initiatives in the secure messaging space.

### Security, Privacy, Censorship Resistance
Assumes the basics such as end-to-end encryption, forward secrecy, avoiding MITM-attacks. Vac also places a premium on privacy and censorship resistance from port blocking, traffic analysis, and similar.

### Modular System
Provide options at each layer in the stack, instead of having a tightly coupled set of protocols. Allowing developers to choose what they use and ensure they know each choice comes with different trade-offs.


### Generalized Messaging
This includes both human to human communication, as well as machine to machine communication. Texting, data transfer, financial transactions, state channels and more.

## Principles

## Research
The research team is focused on research and specifications of protocols within the general scope of Vac. Waku v2 is the current main focus, and the main client is nim-waku.
